Code that implements the NmfSync method for the synchronisation of partial 
permutation matrices, as described in [1]. When you use this code, you are
required to cite [1].

Please refer to demo_nmfsync.m for an example how to use this code.


Note: a custom version of Matlab's nnmf() function for nonegative matrix 
factorisation method has been used to obtain better memory efficiency. Due
